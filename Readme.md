# PyShapeArea

The module needs for calculating area of geometrical shapes

## Using

First, import library:

```python
import pyshapearea
```

Than you can use all functions of the library like this:

Calculating circle area - `print(circle(1))`  
Calculating triangle area - `print(triangle(3,4,5))`  
Checking, if a triangle is right triangle - `print(right_triangle(3,4,5))`
